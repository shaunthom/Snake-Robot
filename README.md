# Snake-Robot

It was funded by the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment (KSCSTE) . As inferred from the name, it resembles a biological snake. It is a four-wheel-drive surveillance device with an image capturing and audio recording facility, controlled by a wireless joystick module. It can survey hazardous areas and report back all the findings even real-time. Our team used motor-driving circuits to accomplish the project.

### Objective:

To develop a cutting-edge robotic monitoring solution, in collaboration with The Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment (KSCSTE). It is aimed at enhancing surveillance capabilities in hazardous environments.

### Basic Principle:



### Working:

      All appropriate codes have been uploaded. The following are some brief descriptions of each C++ code:

##### 1. H-Bridge Motor Driving circuit.cpp :

This code controls a robot with two motors using a joystick. It reads joystick inputs for both vertical (forward/backward) and horizontal (left/right) movements. Based on the joystick's position, it adjusts the motor speeds and directions to control the robot's motion. The robot can move forward, backward, turn left, turn right, or stop, all based on the joystick's position. Motor speeds are adjusted using PWM signals, and the code ensures smooth control by preventing low-speed 'buzzing.'
